# REPORT.md
## Garfish Digital Codebase Analysis (`src` Directory)

### 1. Metadata & Layout
- **`layout.tsx`**: Uses Next.js 13+ app directory conventions. Metadata is set correctly. No anomalies detected.
- **`globals.css`**: Imported in layout, assumed to be used for global styles.

### 2. Page Components
- **`page.tsx`** (root): Uses Framer Motion for animated logo/byline and navigation icons. No unused imports. Inline styles are used for typography.
- **`gallery/page.tsx`**: 
  - Uses Framer Motion for navigation and demo cards.
  - Conditional rendering of icons in navigation (see previous recommendations for smoother transitions).
  - No unused imports detected.
  - Some inline styles and classNames could be consolidated for maintainability.

### 3. Icons & Navigation
- **Heroicons**: Only imported icons are used.
- **Navigation**: All `<Link>` components point to valid routes.

### 4. Animation
- **Framer Motion**: Used throughout. No unused motion components. Some animation props could be simplified for consistency.

### 5. CSS & Styling
- **Inline Styles**: Used for typography and icon positioning. Consider moving repeated styles to CSS classes for maintainability.
- **Class Names**: Custom classes like `home-page-container`, `gallery-page-home-icon`, etc. Ensure these are defined in your CSS files.

### 6. Unused Code/Files
- No unused imports or files detected in the provided excerpts.
- No evidence of dead code or commented-out blocks.

### 7. Outliers & Anomalies
- **Conditional Rendering in Navigation**: As previously discussed, conditional rendering of icons inside `<motion.button>` can cause flashing. Refactor as recommended for smoother transitions.
- **Manual Transform + Framer Motion**: If you use manual transforms (e.g., for tilt/parallax) on the same element as Framer Motion, animation conflicts may occur, especially on iOS.
- **Metadata**: `robots: "noindex, nofollow"` is set, which will prevent search engines from indexing the site. Confirm this is intentional.

### 8. Recommendations
- Refactor conditional icon rendering in navigation for smoother transitions.
- Move repeated inline styles to CSS classes.
- Review use of manual transforms with Framer Motion to avoid conflicts.
- Confirm robots meta tag is intentional.
- Periodically run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` to catch unused code and errors.
